Today is my first day bartending at the Lounge.
It's a quaint spot right in the center of this system.
It doesn't get a lot of foreign guests, but locals always seem to be orbiting the place.
It wasn't an easy decision, accepting a job millions of light-years away. But, I'm finally here.

I'm supposed to be meeting my new boss Sol here for onboarding, but I'm not even sure what they look like.
They seemed nice during our Signal Calls, though.

        The Lounge has some very important clientele.

        I graciously accept your kind words. The Lounge is my pride and joy.

Come behind the counter. We need to get started.
And bring your things, I'll take them to your room in a moment. 
Are you ready to make your first drink as the Lounge's newest bartender?

        More than ready, Sol! I've been dreaming of this moment for a long time.

        Maybe in a little while. I'm pretty pooped.

Most drinks are a combination of three things - a base, a modifier, and an accent.
We like keep our ingredient list short, but don't let that fool you.
There's a myriad of drinks you can make.
It's very important to pay attention to what a customer likes so that you can make them the right drink.
Our guests typically know exactly what they want, so there should be nothing to worry about for now.
Once they get comfortable with you bartending, they'll be more willing to let you surprise them.
Here comes our first customer now, I'll take you through the steps.
